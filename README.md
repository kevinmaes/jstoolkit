Base scaffolding for apps and projects

This is to facilitate quick and easy setup of new projects with common tools.

The master branch will have the most commonly shared tools whereas an advanced
branch will have a complete set of tools. After pulling from master,
individual projects can tweak the setup to either augment the master branch or
remove unwanted elements from the advanced branch, whichever takes less effort.
