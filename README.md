# nitro-client-scaffolding

This is to facilitate quick and easy setup of new projects and to allow us to
standardize our toolset across all projects. Projects should fork this repo
in order to get started.

The master branch will have the most commonly shared tools whereas an advanced
branch will have a complete set of tools. After forking, individual projects
can tweak the setup to either augment the master branch or remove unwanted
elements from the advanced branch, whichever takes less effort.
